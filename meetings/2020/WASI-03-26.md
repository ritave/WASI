1. Proposals and discussions
    1. WASI currently uses a POSIX-like `errno` enum, but that seems
       not well suited for less POSIX-like APIs:
       https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI-crypto/pull/13#issuecomment-599324384
       Many systems have evolved to having a single error enum shared
       across the whole system. Is it ok if we don't aim for that?
    1. POSIX tries hard not to let syscalls cause segfaults, returning
       things like `EFAULT` instead. There may be some value in this for
       POSIX compatibility, but how valuable is this otherwise? Should
       other WASI APIs be allowed to trap?
    1. Evolving idea: wasi-sdk API for extra emulation:
       1. `-D_WASILIBC_EMULATED_MMAN`
       1. `-D_WASILIBC_EMULATED_PAUSE`
       1. `-D_WASILIBC_EMULATED_RAISE`
       1. ...
       1. `-D_WASILIBC_EMULATED_ALL` ?
       and
       1. `-lwasi-emulated-mman`
       1. `-lwasi-emulated-pause`
       1. `-lwasi-emulated-raise`
       1. ...
       1. `-lwasi-emulated-all` ?
    1. Added support for utime.h header
       1. [Work in progress pull request](https://github.com/blockhunters/wasi-libc/pull/1)
       1. Friendly hello from our team and explanation of why we use WASI in the first place
